# JS Adagrams

<!-- Instructors: The checkmarks are already there, so just delete them for any line items that aren't met. -->

## Major Learning Goals/Code Review

<!-- Instructors: Feel free to practice creating specific feedback by referencing a line of code if you'd like. For example, you may say something like "nice custom method in `calculator.rb` line 42." This is optional. -->

| Criteria | yes/no, and optionally any details/lines of code to reference |
| --- | --- |
| Correctly uses variables, and only uses `const` and `let` variables. The program prefers `const` variables. The program never uses `var`. | ✔️?
| Practices best-practices in JavaScript syntax. There are semi-colons at the end of most lines that need semi-colons. Variables and functions are named with camelCase. | ✔️?
| Correctly creates and calls functions within an object with proper syntax (parameters, return statements, etc.) | ✔️?
| Uses correct syntax for conditional logic and iteration | ✔️?
| Practices git with at least 3 small commits and meaningful commit messages | ✔️?
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; tests can run using the command `$ npm test test/adagrams.test.js` and we see test successes and/or failures | ✔️?

## Functional Requirements

| Functional Requirement | yes/no |
| --- | --- |
| For the `drawLetters` function, there is an appropriate data structure to store the letter distribution. (You are more likely to draw an 'E' than an 'X'.) | ✔️?
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; all tests for `drawLetters` and `usesAvailableLetters` pass | ✔️?
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; all tests for `scoreWord` pass | ✔️?
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; all tests for `highestScoreFrom` pass | ✔️?

## Overall Feedback

| Overall Feedback | Criteria | yes/no |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green (Meets/Exceeds Standards) | 5+ in Code Review && 3+ in Functional Requirements | 
| Yellow (Approaches Standards) | 4+ in Code Review && 2+ in Functional Requirements, or the instructor judges that this project needs special attention | 
| Red (Not at Standard) | 0-3 in Code Review or 0,1 in Functional Reqs, or assignment is breaking/doesn’t run with less than 5 minutes of debugging, or the instructor judges that this project needs special attention |

## Code Style Bonus Awards

<!-- Instructors: Please strike a balance between liberal/stingy with these. These are simply built-in pieces of positive feedback; use this to encourage and push students towards a cleaner code style! -->

Was the code particularly impressive in code style for any of these reasons (or more...?)
